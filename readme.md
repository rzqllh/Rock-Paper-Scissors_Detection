## Project Overview
In this project, we will create a CNN model to classify hand gestures of rock, paper, and scissors. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle. Here's an overview of the project steps:

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed and set up your Kaggle API key:

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.kaggle.com/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors) dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of hand gestures representing rock, paper, and scissors.
