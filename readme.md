Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classifier, powered by machine learning (ML)!

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image:** Choose a photo of a hand gesture (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. **Predict Gesture:** Our ML model will analyze the image and predict whether it's rock, paper, or scissors.
3. **Instant Results:** You'll receive instant feedback on the predicted gesture.

## The Technology
- **Machine Learning Magic:** Our model has been trained on a diverse dataset of hand gesture images.
- **Deep Learning:** It uses deep learning techniques to understand and classify the images.
- **Fast and Accurate:** Get accurate predictions in a matter of seconds!

## What's It For?
- Fun Experimentation: Test different hand poses and see how the model responds.
- Educational Insights: Learn about image classification and ML in a hands-on way.
