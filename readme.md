# Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification using TensorFlow and Keras

This project demonstrates how to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of rock, paper, and scissors. The dataset used for this project is the Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset available on Kaggle.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Kaggle API Key**: You need a Kaggle API key to download the dataset. Place your Kaggle API key as `kaggle.json` in the `/root/.kaggle/` directory in your Colab environment.

2. **Python and Libraries**: Ensure you have Python installed, as well as the necessary libraries. You can install these libraries using `pip`.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/rzqllh/Lib_mngmnt-App.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   **pip install flask**
